# Python Practice with CodeWithHarry

This repository contains my Python programming practice based on the [CodeWithHarry Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ah7DDtYtflgwMwpT3xmjXY9) on YouTube. I am following along the course and organizing my code chapter-wise for easy tracking and revision.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `Chapter 1/` â€“ Basics of Python, variables, data types, and input/output.
- `Chapter 2/` â€“ Conditional statements, loops, and logic building.
- `Chapter 3/` â€“ Functions, recursion, and basic problem-solving.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

- Strengthen my fundamentals in Python.
- Practice coding by solving exercises.
- Build consistency through structured learning.
